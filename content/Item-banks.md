Besides fixed-format questionnaires, I’ve also worked on the development and evaluation of item response theory (IRT) based item banks and derived short forms and computerized adaptive tests (CATs), including:

- The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS): physical function item bank, short-form and CAT ([Info](http://www.dutchflemishpromis.nl/))
- The Rasch assessment of everyday activity limitations (REAL): item bank, short-form and CAT ([Info](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-017-1627-0))
